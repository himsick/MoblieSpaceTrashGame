7. **Project Description:**
   - Your player pilots a spacecraft around a planet to collect pieces of space trash.
   - Objective: Collect trash to increase score; collisions reduce health.
   - Challenges: Issues with spaceship movement and joystick controls; used buttons instead.
   - Moons spawn trash every 20 seconds; ship leaves trash if hit.

8. **Nielsen Usability Heuristics:**
   - Show game states clearly (e.g., trash selection, collisions).
   - Display health bar for player health status.
   - Ensure visibility of important game elements.

9. **Problems Overcame:**

   - Difficulty implementing joystick controls; opted for button controls.
   - Time-consuming process but manageable.
